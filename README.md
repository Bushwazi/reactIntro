# React Intro

## Reworked files for "Build Realtime Apps | React Js, Golang &amp; RethinkDB" Udemy Class

* The course files were date and after following the videos, I was getting an error on compile
* To address the fixes, I walked through WebPack's current documentation, add all the same modules as their most recent version
* Moved all the source files into /src
* Updated repo to use prop-types because it was moved out of React
